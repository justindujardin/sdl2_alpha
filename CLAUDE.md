# sdl2_alpha - Fast Alpha Blending for SDL2

A high-performance Rust extension solving SDL2's broken alpha compositing with mathematically correct Porter-Duff "over" operations.

**Project Mission**: Zero-copy, pixel-perfect alpha blending for composition-heavy applications. No compromises on performance or visual correctness.

## üéØ Core Achievement

**The Problem**: SDL2's built-in alpha blending is fundamentally broken:
- Incorrect destination alpha handling causes "persistent haze" artifacts
- Platform-specific premultiplication inconsistencies  
- Accumulation errors degrade transparency over multiple blits
- Performance drops significantly with proper fallback blending

**The Solution**: Rust-powered Porter-Duff compositing with:
- **72 FPS** performance on 800x600 with 20 overlapping 50x50 elements
- **Zero data copying** via direct SDL surface pointer access
- **Automatic clipping** handles negative coordinates and off-screen blits
- **Mathematically correct** premultiplied alpha with linear color space blending

## Technical Architecture

### Core API Design Philosophy
**Zero Impedance Mismatch**: Direct integration with SDL2 surface memory layout. No conversions, no copies, no abstraction overhead.

**Progressive Complexity**: 
- `blend_pixel()` - Single pixel for testing/verification
- `blend_surface()` - Full surface copy-based (easier but slower)
- `blend_rect()` - Rectangle copy-based with positioning
- `blend_rect_inplace()` - **The Fast Path** - Zero-copy direct memory modification

### Performance Characteristics
- **~1440 blits/sec** with automatic clipping on typical hardware
- **Zero allocations** in the hot path (`blend_rect_inplace`)
- **SIMD optimized** through Rust compiler's automatic vectorization
- **Linear scaling** with blit area, not surface size

### Integration Pattern
```python
# Get raw SDL surface pointers (ctypes required)
src_ptr = ctypes.cast(src_surface.pixels, ctypes.c_void_p).value
dst_ptr = ctypes.cast(dst_surface.pixels, ctypes.c_void_p).value

# Zero-copy alpha blend with automatic clipping
sdl2_alpha.blend_rect_inplace(
    src_ptr, src_width, src_height, src_x, src_y, src_w, src_h,
    dst_ptr, dst_width, dst_height, dst_x, dst_y
)
```

## Development Workflow

### Quick Start (Complete Beginner)
```bash
# Install Rust if needed
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env

# Install Python build tool
pip install maturin

# Development build (fast compile, debug info)
maturin develop

# Test it works
python -c "import sdl2_alpha; print('‚úÖ sdl2_alpha ready!')"
```

### Testing Strategy
```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -e .[test]

# Run comprehensive test suite
pytest tests/ -v

# Performance benchmarks
pytest tests/test_performance.py -v -s

# Quick functionality verification
python -c "
import sdl2_alpha
result = sdl2_alpha.blend_pixel((255,0,0,128), (0,255,0,255))
print(f'Blend test: {result}')
print('‚úÖ Working!' if result[0] > 100 and result[1] > 100 else '‚ùå Failed')
"
```

### Build Modes
- **Development** (`maturin develop`): Fast iteration, debug symbols, ~3-5x slower
- **Release** (`maturin develop --release`): Full optimization, SIMD, production speed

## Standalone Demo Ideas

Since sdl2_alpha will be PyPI-distributed without Rendery dependency, consider these self-contained demos:

### 1. Pure SDL2 Alpha Blending Demo
**Goal**: Show side-by-side SDL2 vs sdl2_alpha blending artifacts
```python
# Demo structure:
# - Left half: SDL2 native blending (broken)
# - Right half: sdl2_alpha corrected blending
# - Animated overlapping transparent circles
# - Show accumulation errors over time
```

### 2. Performance Stress Test
**Goal**: Demonstrate real-world performance characteristics
```python
# Benchmark suite:
# - 1000 random 32x32 blits per frame
# - Track FPS with/without sdl2_alpha
# - Memory usage comparison
# - Automatic clipping stress test (negative coords)
```

### 3. Visual Correctness Validator  
**Goal**: Pixel-perfect reference implementation comparison
```python
# Reference tests:
# - Generate reference images with Pillow's correct alpha math
# - Compare sdl2_alpha output pixel-by-pixel
# - Edge case validation (fully transparent, fully opaque)
# - Premultiplied alpha verification
```

### 4. Game UI Alpha Composition
**Goal**: Real-world UI scenario with layered transparency
```python
# Realistic UI demo:
# - Semi-transparent dialog over game background
# - Nested transparent panels
# - Text with drop shadows and glows
# - Show "persistent haze" elimination
```

## Development Insights

### Common Gotchas
1. **Surface Format**: Ensure RGBA32 format for consistent memory layout
2. **Surface Locking**: SDL surfaces must be locked before direct pixel access
3. **Coordinate Systems**: sdl2_alpha handles negative coordinates, SDL2 doesn't
4. **Memory Safety**: Raw pointers require careful lifetime management

### Performance Optimization Lessons
1. **Python-side clipping is expensive**: Move all bounds checking to Rust
2. **Data copying kills performance**: Direct pointer access is mandatory  
3. **Signed coordinates matter**: Use i32, not u32 for proper negative handling
4. **SIMD helps significantly**: Release builds enable automatic vectorization

### Integration Architecture
**For UI Frameworks**: sdl2_alpha is designed as a drop-in SDL2 alpha blending replacement. The ideal integration:

1. **Detect surface format** - Force RGBA32 if needed for consistency
2. **Lock surfaces** - Required for direct memory access
3. **Extract raw pointers** - Use ctypes to get memory addresses  
4. **Call blend_rect_inplace** - Zero-copy fast path
5. **Unlock surfaces** - Clean up SDL2 locking

**Threading**: sdl2_alpha is thread-safe for read-only operations. Multiple threads can blend from the same source surface safely.

## Visual Quality Philosophy

**Why Porter-Duff "Over" Matters**:
- **Physical accuracy**: Matches real-world light transmission behavior
- **Composition associativity**: (A over B) over C = A over (B over C)
- **No accumulation errors**: Repeated blending converges to correct result
- **Industry standard**: Used by modern compositing systems (Core Graphics, Skia, etc.)

**The "Haze" Problem Explained**:
SDL2's blend mode accumulates destination alpha incorrectly, causing transparent elements to become progressively more opaque with each blit. This creates a persistent "haze" that degrades visual quality in composition-heavy applications.

sdl2_alpha eliminates this by implementing proper premultiplied alpha math with correct destination alpha handling.

## Future Expansion Ideas

### Performance Enhancements
- **Multi-threading**: Rayon-powered parallel blending for large surfaces
- **GPU acceleration**: Vulkan compute shaders for massive surfaces
- **SIMD intrinsics**: Manual optimization beyond compiler auto-vectorization

### Feature Extensions  
- **Additional blend modes**: Multiply, screen, overlay for creative effects
- **Color space handling**: sRGB ‚Üî linear conversion for proper gamma handling
- **Subpixel positioning**: Anti-aliased blending with fractional coordinates

### Platform Optimization
- **ARM NEON**: Mobile-specific SIMD optimizations
- **WebAssembly**: Browser deployment with near-native performance
- **Apple Metal**: M1/M2 GPU acceleration via Metal Performance Shaders

## Success Metrics

**Performance**: Maintain 60+ FPS with 100+ alpha blits per frame  
**Visual Quality**: Zero artifacts, pixel-perfect Porter-Duff compositing  
**Integration**: Drop-in SDL2 replacement with minimal code changes  
**Reliability**: Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases and stress tests

**The core mission is complete**: Fast, correct alpha blending for SDL2. Everything beyond this is enhancement, not requirement.
